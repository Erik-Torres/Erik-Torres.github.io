        <p>University capstone project where I worked in a team of 6 to develop a mock buy and sell website intended for students. 
          I was primarily focused on the back-end and contributed to database design decisions as well as implementing a 
          messaging system for the users. My contributions were made using Node.js, EJS, and MySQL</p>
